# RoboButler
RoboButler has three primary functions. First, RoboButler must feel real. It responds to good morning and afternoon messages, 
with the appropriate time of day. It also response to certain reactions and strings. Secondly, RoboButler is a webscraper. 
I should be able to extract information from a couple news sources from RoboButler through the chat. Finally, RoboButler should 
coordinate calendars for each of the discord's members. Every user should have a calendar, upon which reminders can be placed.
