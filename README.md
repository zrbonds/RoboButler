# RoboButler

RoboButler is a Discord digital assistant.
RoboButler is powered by the Stanford CoreNLP package, which allows it to parse plaintext user statements and then
associate them with one of RoboButler's commands. RoboButler's current functionality is to set reminders for users, and then
message them at the appropriate time. Commands in progress include providing weather information and moderating a suite of 
chat based games (most notably, Ultimate Werewolf, the code for which exists in another bot).
